# About the Game
Beerpoly is a brand new project made by people brought up in Poznan. It’s based on iconic game Monopoly, but the climate of this city and unusual ideas will make it a perfect entertainment for every group of friends seeking for enjoyment. What does stand out so much that people will play it? Balanced solutions, places you can visit during a casual trip in Poznan, new quests and before all - convenience. We are out trying to roll a stockbroker for the best quality, both physical and virtual. Yes, it means that it will be available to print out, so you could play it anytime. Nevertheless, if you prefer so, you can play on your mobile device - without any flying cards or cash.

## About Us
We are a group of young ambitious people, who can’t stand sitting in one place. All of us have strong connections with Poznan and we know each other for a couple of years. However, it is the first time, when our skills are going to create a bigger thing. Beerpoly is our mutual project, but it is not said that the last one. We really encourage you to watch our efforts; it means a lot for us. And it is quite possible, that you could also find something for you.
